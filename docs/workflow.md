# Workflow

This is also inspired by Handmade Hero. 

Basically I have a text editor and a build script that runs the compiler. If I need to debug then I run the binary with a debugger attached. It's a simple setup to focus on the game programming instead of complex build systems and tools.

More concretely:
- Neovim for editing
- cl.exe for compiling
- Visual Studio for debugging
- RenderDoc for debugging graphics
